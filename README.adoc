Purpose
-------
Setting up a DocBook build environment seems to be extra difficult and
cumbersome.  The goal of this project is to create a platform
independent, easy to depoly environment that brings you to the core
tasks of getting started with THE document within seconds.

.Objectives
- Incorate all the wisdom and hints from
  http://www.docbook.org/tdg51/en/html/
- Be platform independent -> embrace the Java eco-system as much as
  possible
- Make building DocBook documents a breeze

Setup
-----
0. Get all the additional software (see section Additional Software).
   Hopefully, you've to do this just once (in a while).
1. Copy a DocBook template from templates into the root directory
2. The file build.properties holds the general settings for building a
   DocBook file.  Platform specific values are stored in the
   build.properties.PLATFORM files.  The one thing you have to customize
   is the filename of your main DocBook file:
   build.properties -> main.file
   - Customization of stylesheets is possible, check out
   	 stylesheets/fo/docbook.xsl
3. Start writing your document

Build Tasks / Functionatlity
----------------------------
Run the following tasks the create the desired output
format, e.g. "ant pdf".  All output is stored it the directory "build",
it's customizable throught the variable "output.dir":

pdf           : create PDF output (default task)
epub          : create EPUB output
epub3         : create EPUB3 output
xhtml         : create XHTML output
xhtmlchunk    : create chunked XHTML output
xhtml5        : create XHTML5 output
xhtml5chunk   : create chunked XHTML5 output
validate      : validates the DocBook document
clean         : delete all dynamically created files/the "out" directory
test          : execute all creation tasks one after the other

Additional software
-------------------
Make sure you have a working Java/Ant setup: https://www.java.com/,
http://ant.apache.org

In addition you need the software listed in file lib/README.
