= DocBook Bootstrap
== Purpose
Setting up a DocBook build environment seems to be extra difficult and
cumbersome.  The goal of this project is to create a platform
independent, easy to depoly environment that brings you to the core
tasks of getting started with THE document within seconds.

.Objectives
- Incorate all the wisdom and hints from
  http://www.docbook.org/tdg51/en/html/
- Be platform independent -> embrace the Java eco-system as much as
  possible
- Make building DocBook documents a breeze

== Setup
0. Get all the additional software (see section Additional Software
   Needed).  Hopefully, you've to do this just once (in a while).
1. Make a copy of the `template` folder and put it where you want to
   create your next document/project.  Adjust the `Makefile` as needed.
3. Start writing your document!
4. Do you need more customization?  Ok, here you go:  The file
   build.properties holds the general settings for building a DocBook
   file.  Platform specific values are stored in the
   build.properties.PLATFORM files.  Customization of stylesheets is
   possible.  Check out the included stylesheet for some ideas:
   `stylesheets/fo/docbook.xsl`

== Usage

=== Build Tasks
Run the following tasks the create the desired output
format, e.g. "ant pdf".  All output is stored it the directory "build",
it's customizable throught the variable "output.dir":

pdf           : create PDF output (default task)
epub          : create EPUB output
epub3         : create EPUB3 output
xhtml         : create XHTML output
xhtmlchunk    : create chunked XHTML output
xhtml5        : create XHTML5 output
xhtml5chunk   : create chunked XHTML5 output
validate      : validates the DocBook document
clean         : delete all dynamically created files/the "out" directory
test          : execute all creation tasks one after the other

=== Input Formats
It's also possible to convert files in the Asciidoc format to DocBook
and than to the different output formats.  Set property
`file.format` to `asciidoc` and change `file.suffix` to the
suffix of the input file - it's necessary because there doesn't seem to
be way to figure this out using Ant.

=== Examples
.Convert any DocBook file to PDF without editing build.properties
This takes advantage of ant's ability to specify properties on the
commmand line.

`ant -Dfile=myfile.xml pdf`

.Convert this Asciidoc file to PDF
Actually, it doesn't work yet!  The reason is that Asciidoc doesn't ship
a DocBook 5 backend.  When you run this command, you can take the
resulting DocBook file (build/README.xml) and tweak it to make compile
properly.

`ant -Dfile=README.adoc -Dfile.format=asciidoc -Dfile.suffix=adoc pdf`

== Additional Software Needed!
Make sure you have a working Java/Ant setup: https://www.java.com/ and
http://ant.apache.org

*In addition you need to download the software listed in file
lib/README.*
