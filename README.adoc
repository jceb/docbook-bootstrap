= DocBook Bootstrap

== Purpose
Setting up a DocBook build environment seems to be extra difficult and
cumbersome.  The goal of this project is to create a platform
independent, easy to depoly environment that brings you to the core
tasks of getting started with THE document within seconds.

.Objectives
* Incorate all wisdom and hints from
  http://www.docbook.org/tdg51/en/html/
* Be platform independent -> embrace the Java eco-system as much as
  possible
* Make using DocBook a breeze

== Setup and Usage

image::https://github.com/jceb/docbook-bootstrap/blob/master/examples/clone-template.gif[Set up docbook project]

1. Get all the additional software (see section
   <<additional-software-needed,Additional Software Needed>>).
   Hopefully, you've to do this just once (in a while).
2. Make a copy of the `template` folder and put it where you want to
   create your next document/project.
   * The `clone-template` script will do the work under Linux and
     MacOSX.
   * For Windows adjust the `Makefile` as needed.  (The document can
     also be passed as an argument to make: `make in=FILE`)
   * Many <<input_formats,input formats>> are supported
3. Start writing your document!
4. Run `make` to convert the document to PDF.  It will be stored in the
   `build` directory.
   * Additional <<output_formats,outupt formats>> are supported
   * Example: `make html` to create HTML output
   * Example2: `make help` to get a list of supported output formats
5. Do you need more customization?  Ok, here you go:  The file
   `build.properties` holds the general settings for building a DocBook
   file.  Platform specific values are stored in the
   `build.properties.PLATFORM` files.  Customization of stylesheets is
   possible.  Check out the included stylesheet for some ideas:
   `stylesheets/fo/docbook.xsl`

[[output_formats]]
=== Output Formats / Build Tasks
Run the following tasks the create the desired output
format, e.g. `ant pdf`.  All output is stored it the directory `build`,
it's customizable throught the variable `output.dir`:

* `pdf`           : create PDF output (default task)
* `epub`          : create EPUB output
* `epub3`         : create EPUB3 output
* `xhtml`         : create XHTML output
* `xhtmlchunk`    : create chunked XHTML output
* `xhtml5`        : create XHTML5 output
* `xhtml5chunk`   : create chunked XHTML5 output
* `validate`      : validates the DocBook document
* `clean`         : delete all dynamically created files/the "out" directory
* `test`          : execute all creation tasks one after the other

[[input_formats]]
=== Input Formats
* http://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc]
* http://docbook.org/[DocBook]
* http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/[Markdown]
* http://orgmode.org[Org mode]
* http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html[reStructuredText]
* and many more through http://pandoc.org/[Pandoc]

See section <<additional_software,Additional Software Needed>> for more
information.  Set property `file.format` to `asciidoc` and change
`file.suffix` to the suffix of the input file - it's necessary because
there doesn't seem to be way to figure this out using Ant.

=== Examples
.Convert any DocBook file to PDF without editing build.properties
This takes advantage of ant's ability to specify properties on the
commmand line.

 ant -Dfile=myfile.xml pdf

.Convert this AsciiDoc file to PDF
Actually, it doesn't work yet!  The reason is that AsciiDoc doesn't ship
a DocBook 5 backend.  When you run this command, you can take the
resulting DocBook file (build/README.xml) and tweak it to make compile
properly.

 ant -Dfile=README.adoc -Dfile.format=asciidoc -Dfile.suffix=adoc pdf

== Customization

=== Include custom Fonts
It is possible to include custom fonts into fop-generated
documents.  Follow these steps:

.Include True Type Fonts
Copy all required True Type Fonts in the directory `lib/fonts`.

.Generate XML description for the custom True Type Font
Execute the following command in the fop folder `lib/fop` to generate an
XML description for each font:

 for font in ../fonts/*.ttf; do
   java -cp lib/commons-io-1.3.1.jar:lib/commons-logging-1.0.4.jar:build/fop.jar:lib/avalon-framework-cvs-20020806.jar:lib/xml-apis.jar:lib/xercesImpl-2.2.1.jar:lib/xalan-2.4.1.jar org.apache.fop.fonts.apps.TTFReader "${font}" "${font%.ttf}.xml"
 done

On Linux and Mac OS X systems executing the command
`lib/fonts/compile.sh` will perform this task as well.

The following discussions might also be of interest to you:

* Discussion at http://www.mail-archive.com/fop-user@xml.apache.org/msg13631.html
* More information at http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/0.94/fonts.html#register

.Include fonts in fop.xconf
Add the custom font to the fonts section.  Here is an example for the
ukai font:

 <fonts>
 ...
 <font metrics-url="lib/fonts/ukai.xml" kerning="yes" embed-url="lib/fonts/ukai.ttf">
   <font-triplet name="ARPLZenKaiUni" style="normal" weight="normal"/>
   <font-triplet name="ARPLZenKaiUni" style="normal" weight="bold"/>
   <font-triplet name="ARPLZenKaiUni" style="italic" weight="normal"/>
   <font-triplet name="ARPLZenKaiUni" style="italic" weight="bold"/>
 </font>
 ...
 </fonts>

.Include fonts in stylesheet
Add the font to the fo-stylesheet (`stylesheets/fo/docbook.xsl`):

 <xsl:param name='title.font.family'>sans-serif,ARPLZenKaiUni</xsl:param>
 <xsl:param name='body.font.family'>serif,ARPLZenKaiUni</xsl:param>

There are even more font family parameters that can be set:

 <xsl:param name='monospace.font.family'>monospace</xsl:param>
 <xsl:param name='symbol.font.family'>Symbol,ZapfDingbats</xsl:param>

[[additional_software]]
== Additional Software Needed!
* Make sure you have a working https://www.java.com/[Java] and
  http://ant.apache.org/[Ant] setup
* For AsciiDoc input http://ascidoctor.org[Asciidoctor] needs to be
  installed
* For any other input form http://pandoc.org/[Pandoc] needs to be
  installed

IMPORTANT: *You also need to download the software listed in file link:SETUP[].*

* If you are running Linux or Mac OS X, executing `setup.sh` will
  download all dependencies
