This document lists all the libraries you need to successfully convert a
DocBook document into PDF and a lot of end-user formats.

Run setup.sh to download all required libraries.


ISO690_bibliography: http://wiki.docbook.org/ISO690Bibliography or if not
reachable, here: http://markmail.org/message/n2qumyhk2togibuf
Dockumentation of ISO690 for docbook.

ant: http://ant.apache.org/
Apache Ant is a Java library and command-line tool that help building software.

ant-contrib: https://github.com/srstclair/ant-contrib and http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net/
The ant contrib library provides a lot of convenience tasks for
controlling the work flow with the build.xml.  I'm working on removing
this dependency, because ant-contrib is not maintained anymore.

db4-upgrade.xsl: https://docbook.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/docbook/trunk/docbook/relaxng/tools/db4-upgrade.xsl
Stylesheet to convert DocBook 4 documents to DocBook 5.

docbook.rng: http://www.docbook.org/xml/5.0/rng/docbook.rng
DocBook 5 RelaxNG schema definition required for validation.

docbook-xsl: http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook/files/docbook-xsl/
Stylesheets for transforming DocBook data into the various output
formats.  This is the project that does the hard work of producing
usable output for the user!

fonts:
Drop TrueType fonts in here for conversion.

jeuclid-fop: http://jeuclid.sourceforge.net/
Fop extension to handle MathML.

fop: https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/
Library for processing XSL-FO data and turning it into a PDF,
eventually.

jing: https://code.google.com/p/jing-trang/
Validates XML data against different schema formats.  It also supports
RELAX NG which is the recommended way to validate DocBook.  Other
validators can be found at http://relaxng.org/#validators.

offo-hyphenation-binary: http://offo.sourceforge.net/
Hyphenation support for fop.

saxon: http://saxon.sf.net/
XSLT/XPath/XQuery processor.  Needed to transform the actual DocBook
data into the various formats using docbook-xsl.  On a Unix system you
can also use xsltproc if you don't want to use saxon.

This is how my lib directory looks like.  I recommend creating symlinks
for being independent of the version that's included in the directory
