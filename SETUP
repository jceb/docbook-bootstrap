This document lists all the libraries you need to successfully convert a
DocBook document into PDF and a lot of end-user formats.

Run setup.sh to download all required libraries.


ISO690_bibliography: http://wiki.docbook.org/ISO690Bibliography or if not
reachable, here: http://markmail.org/message/n2qumyhk2togibuf
Dockumentation of ISO690 for docbook.

ant: http://ant.apache.org/
Apache Ant is a Java library and command-line tool that help building software.

ant-contrib: https://github.com/srstclair/ant-contrib and http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net/
The ant contrib library provides a lot of convenience tasks for
controlling the work flow with the build.xml.  I'm working on removing
this dependency, because ant-contrib is not maintained anymore.

fop: https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/
fop-hyph: http://offo.sourceforge.net/
Library for processing XSL-FO data and turning it into a PDF,
eventually.

saxon: http://saxon.sf.net/
XSLT/XPath/XQuery processor.  Needed to transform the actual DocBook
data into the various formats using docbook-xsl.  On a Unix system you
can also use xsltproc if you don't want to use saxon.

jing: https://code.google.com/p/jing-trang/
Validates XML data against different schema formats.  It also supports
RELAX NG which is the recommended way to validate DocBook.  Other
validators can be found at http://relaxng.org/#validators.

docbook-xsl: http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook/files/docbook-xsl/
Stylesheets for transforming DocBook data into the various output
formats.  This is the project that does the hard work of producing
usable output for the user!

This is how my lib directory looks like.  I recommend creating symlinks
for being independent of the version that's included in the directory
